Summary\
My data visualisation shows the relationship between baseball players batting average and their heights and handedness. According to the chart, it is very interesting that different handedness result in different batting average, while height of player seems to have little effect on average.\
1. Players with left handedness usually have better batting average than right or both handed players.\
2. Batting average doesn't vary by height for the middle of the data set. At the extremes it does vary but it might be because there are so few data points.\
\
Design\
I choose scatter plot to visualise those data. The plot includes three factors, handedness, height and batting average. I use batting average as the performance index, and use height and handedness as the impact factors. X axis is height, and y axis is battering average. I also use different colour to represent different handedness, left, right and both handed. As there are too many points and it is barely to see the performance difference with different handedness, I make animation to outstand each kind of handedness once.\
\
Feedback & Adjustment\
1
\f1 . 
\f0 color change\
The original colour for three kinds of handedness are similar to each other and difficult to distinguish. Therefore I change there colour to make them contrast more to each other.\
\
2. y axis name change\
The column name of batting average is \'93avg\'94 in the original dataset. I used it as the y axis name. I was then told that \'93avg\'94 is not very clear for description. Therefore I change it from \'93avg\'94 to \'93BattingAvg\'94 so that y axis has clear meaning.\
\
3. title change\
I used \'93Baseball Players Analysis\'94 as my title at first. People suggested that I should use a more specific title. And I change my title to \'93Baseball Players Performance Regarding Height & Handedness\'94.\
\
4. y axis adjustment\
I was reminded that y axis is not well-proportioned In my first html. Then I add some codes to set the range and ticks of y axis in order to make it more reasonable.\
\
5. no legend\
I forgot legend at first. In my final edition I add legend for the handedness.\
